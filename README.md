# PDF Tagging & Accessbility Tool


This high-end and user-friendly tool is developed to streamline the process of tagging PDF documents and enhancing their accessibility. The project was completed as part of the University of Melbourne's capstone project for COMP30022 in 2023 Semester 2. It is crafted using a modern tech stack including React.js, React Router, Redux for frontend functionality, and ChakraUI for styling and animations.

The application is designed with a focus on ease of use, offering a seamless experience for users who need to manage PDF documents and increase accessiblity for text based readers. 


## Features

**Frontend Showcase**

This repository primarily serves as a showcase of the frontend implementation of a PDF editing and viewing application and some of the Custom Components created by me. It demonstrates the intended user interface and interactions, although full functionality requires integration with a backend not included in this repository. 

- **PDF Text Selection:** This tool elevates the user experience by enabling the selection and extraction of text from PDF documents. This feature is particularly useful for interacting with text in non-selectable formats, making it easier to work with various types of PDFs.
- **PDF Viewer:** Fleshed out PDF Viewer for easy navigation of PDfs. It includes convenient page thumbnail navigation, smooth page navigation, and versatile zoom options to cater to different viewing preferences.
- **Text-Rich Editor:** After extracting text from PDFs, users can leverage the power of Quill.js for rich-text editing. This feature allows extensive styling and formatting options, enabling users to edit and customize the extracted text to suit their needs. Saved text is stored and can be then edited, changed as required.  
- **Dynamic Routing with React Router:** Provides seamless navigation between different components and pages within the application.
- **Text Reader:** High end text reader with accessiblity features such as zoom, font change, and colours and a table of contents. Once text is generated, Text can be viewed via this page.
